Why is the system hanging? 
There is some problem with creating too many connections on osx. Maybe there is a way to fix this
using tcp_tw_reuse etc but I'm that would require making this work on linux

Wire Protocol:
Get Key
<HEADER>
<STR-GET>
<STR-KEY>

Set Key Value
<HEADER>
<STR-SET>
<STR-KEY>
<STR-VALUE>

Pipelining:
In the absence of non blocking sockets I'll implement pipelining using two threads. One sending on a connection and one receiving.
